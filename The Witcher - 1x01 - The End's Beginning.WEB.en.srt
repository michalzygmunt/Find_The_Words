00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,083
You don't scare me.

72
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:12,958
That's too bad.

73
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,125
And I can also tell you

74
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,958
that my father will have no use
for this beast.

75
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,000
Your father,

76
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:20,708
the alderman?

77
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,250
He posted a flyer.

78
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,375
For a graveir.

79
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,291
kikimoras are useful.

80
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:29,708
Population control.

81
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,833
Hm.

82
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:35,500
You should speak to Master Irion,
our wizard.

83
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,875
He's willing to pay for odds and ends
he needs for elixirs.

84
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,625
I sold him our dog when it died.

85
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:44,375
Mysteriously.

86
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,333
Fine.

87
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,083
Take me to him.

88
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,000
I got 15 crowns for the yappy mutt.

89
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:59,208
That's enough to buy some new clothes.
Just saying.

90
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,125
Hm.

91
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,333
Come on, Roach.
